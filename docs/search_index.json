Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}.

For example, we can look up the ICOSLG information. datatable(annot[which(annot$Gene.symbol == &quot;ICOSLG&quot;), ], rownames = F ) However, most of time, we don’t have such a file that comes with the trancriptomic data. We will then need to annotate the genes. 5.2 Convert gene symbol to gene ID using biomaRt. Since many pathway database requires entrez gene IDs as entries and most of sequencing/ microarray output provides gene symbols or ensembl IDs, we’ll need to convert gene symbol to entrez IDs for the pathway analysis. We can query from the ensembl site manually. Or we can do better usingbiomaRtpackage. For a full tutorial of biomaRt package, see here. It covers some more advanced use case. Here I only cover basic usage of this package. 5.2.1 Connect to the selected BioMart database using useEnsembl function. Before connecting to a specific database, we can first check available databases. 5.2.1.1 List of available BioMart databases hosted by Ensembl # available database datatable(listEnsembl()) # available biological species for the gene databases mart &lt;- useEnsembl(&quot;genes&quot;, mirror = &#39;www&#39;) datatable(listDatasets(mart)) Since we want to convert gene symbol to Entrez gene IDs in human subjects, we select biomart = 'genes' and dataset= 'hsapiens_gene_ensembl'. Use useEnsembl function to setup the connection with ensembl site host. # convert from gene symbol to gene ID ensembl &lt;- useEnsembl( biomart = &quot;genes&quot;, dataset = &quot;hsapiens_gene_ensembl&quot;, mirror = &quot;www&quot; ) 5.2.2 Annotate genes Here instead of selecting genes in a biological pathway, I simply randomly choose some genes in the dataset. set.seed(123) gs1 &lt;- sample(rst$ID, 10) gs2 &lt;- sample(rst$ID, 10) Here I choose five most significantly differentially expressed genes, five genes not differentially expressed. gs3 &lt;- c(head(rst$ID, 5), tail(rst$ID, 5)) print(glue::glue(&#39;geneset 1: {paste0(gs1, collapse = &quot;, &quot;)} geneset 2: {paste0(gs2, collapse =&quot;, &quot;)}\\ngeneset 3: {paste0(gs3, collapse =&quot;, &quot;)}&#39;)) geneset 1: HAUS5, MYDGF, TRAPPC13, LINS1, SLC14A1, DYRK3, EIF3I, NRP2, 207479_at, SESN1 geneset 2: ALDH6A1, MAPKAPK5-AS1, WNT7A, GH1, SMYD2, NT5DC2, CCDC30, MTSS1L, CETP, DZIP3 geneset 3: EBP, H3F3AP4, RAB2A, LOC100506248, MFSD11, NAP1L3, C19orf54, ADGRG6, PHF1, BCL2L14 Retreive the annotated file with getBM function. Since we use gene symbols to match aginst gene IDs, we’ll need to specify the type of input data in the filter argument (filters = \"hgnc_symbol\"). We would like to output the hgnc_symbol,entrezgene_id reference. annotgs3 &lt;- getBM( attributes = c(&quot;hgnc_symbol&quot;, &quot;entrezgene_id&quot;), filters = &quot;hgnc_symbol&quot;, values = gs3, mart = ensembl ) print(annotgs3) hgnc_symbol entrezgene_id 1 ADGRG6 57211 2 BCL2L14 79370 3 EBP 10682 4 MFSD11 79157 5 NAP1L3 4675 6 PHF1 5252 7 RAB2A 5862 Note that not all gene symbols can be perfectly match against gene ID. Alternatively, you can annotate all the gene in the dataset then extract the ones in the genesets. For simplicity, I removed duplicated genes of which have multiple probes correspond to the same gene (isoforms). In practice, the removal of these isoforms should be done with examination of coefficient variation (CV). all_genes &lt;- rst$ID[!duplicated(rst$ID)] Upon removal of duplicates, there are 14063 genes left in the dataset. We annotate these genes. annot_all &lt;- getBM( attributes = c(&quot;hgnc_symbol&quot;, &quot;entrezgene_id&quot;), filters = &quot;hgnc_symbol&quot;, values = all_genes, mart = ensembl ) 5.2.3 Alternative methods for annotation Alternatively one can use bitr function from clusterProfiler package. Here we need to specify the database for curation. This requires the pacakge org.Hs.eg.db. If you decide to go with method, make sure to update this package often to obtain the most current information. The org.Hs.eg.db package is updated biannually. bitr(gs1, fromType = &quot;SYMBOL&quot;, toType = c(&quot;ENTREZID&quot;, &quot;SYMBOL&quot;), OrgDb = org.Hs.eg.db ) SYMBOL ENTREZID 1 HAUS5 23354 2 MYDGF 56005 3 TRAPPC13 80006 4 LINS1 55180 5 SLC14A1 6563 6 DYRK3 8444 7 EIF3I 8668 8 NRP2 8828 10 SESN1 27244 5.3 Curate biological functions Upon selection genes of interest, we can start to curate the biological functions of these genes. The most popular databases are GO, KEGG, Reactome, etc. For full understanding the property of each of these databases, see these references [xxx]. For example, I’d like to query the biological functions of genes in the set 3 . One can use the groupGO function to look up biological functions: MF: Molecular Function molecular activities of gene products CC: Cellular Component where gene products are active BP: Biological Process pathways and larger processes made up of the activities of multiple gene products Additionally, one can look up onto KEGG, WikiPathway, Reactome, Diease Ontology (DO), Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDb). I didn’t find any ready to use functions from clusterProfile package,except for GO query. However, personally, I don’t think statiticians are the experts to interpret the finding in biological sense. Since this is less of interest for analysts, the clusterProfiler simplifed this curation process and combined with the tests (ORA, GSEA) in their function construction. ggo &lt;- groupGO( gene = as.character(annotgs3$entrezgene_id), OrgDb = org.Hs.eg.db, ont = &quot;BP&quot;, level = 3, readable = TRUE ) tail(ggo) ID GO:0051410 GO:0051410 GO:0061687 GO:0061687 GO:0071722 GO:0071722 GO:0140330 GO:0140330 GO:1990961 GO:1990961 GO:0031214 GO:0031214 Description Count GO:0051410 detoxification of nitrogen compound 0 GO:0061687 detoxification of inorganic compound 0 GO:0071722 detoxification of arsenic-containing substance 0 GO:0140330 xenobiotic detoxification by transmembrane export across the cell outer membrane 0 GO:1990961 xenobiotic detoxification by transmembrane export across the plasma membrane 0 GO:0031214 biomineral tissue development 0 GeneRatio geneID GO:0051410 0/7 GO:0061687 0/7 GO:0071722 0/7 GO:0140330 0/7 GO:1990961 0/7 GO:0031214 0/7 5.4 Reference "],["parts.html", "6 Parts", " 6 Parts You can add parts to organize one or more book chapters together.
