<p>The advantage of ORA using R packages, most popular one <code>clusterProfile</code>
(which is the fusion of a few packages) is
that the functions combine the step of database query and the step of testing
in one go. The <code>clusterProfile</code> package currently provide following
biological database.
<img src="https://yulab-smu.top/biomedical-knowledge-mining-book/figures/clusterProfiler-diagram.png" alt="curtesy of clusterProfiler" /></p>
<p>As shown in the graph, the ORA tests with different db queries are prefixed
with <code>enrich</code>, such as <code>enrichGO</code>, <code>enrichDO</code>. Note that these functions
are different than the test above. They first query the biological process
databases and find the genes lie in the pathway(s). Then it will perform the test to see if the genes in the pathways are differentially expressed compared
to the background genes. For example, I’m interested in
the top 10 most significantly differentially expressed genes. I would like
to query the pathways that these genes involve in then test if these pathways
are significantly differentially expressed.</p>

<li>gene: a <strong>character</strong> vector of gene entrez ID in a gene set to be tested</li>
<li>universe: a <strong>character</strong> vector of gene entrez ID in the background gene set</li>
<li>ontology type: biological ontology type. This varies from different reference database. Check specific database for details.</li>
<li>reference database: some function requires the input of database. one can
either use the connection to online db or download to local. This takes big
storage space.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interpretation of results:</p>
<p>I use the result from GO enrichment analysis for illustration. This applies
to the analytical results queried from other databases. From the result object,
one can see that the these top genes were mapped onto 94 gene sets (GO terms).
Out of these 94 sets, 31 were tested significant. The significance cutoff set
up is illustrated in the result object.
To interpret the result table, take the examplle of GO term <code>GO:0043186</code> as
an example. This GO term contains 10 genes, out of the 10 genes, only one
gene is found in our queried list, which contains 6 genes. So the <code>GeneRatio</code>
is 1/6. The pathway. In the background gene set (BgRatio), there are 10
out of 11599 genes. From this we can construct a contingency table below and
perform the Fisher test:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th></th>
<th>GO term</th>
<th>non-Go term</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>geneset</td>
<td>1</td>

I ran into bug from the older version of <code>clusterProfiler</code>.
In order to get this function work, update R version and upgrade <code>DOSE</code>
package if you use online reference. Alternatively download KEGG
reference and set <code>use_internal_data = TRUE</code>.
I can’t upgrade R in my local enviroment and don’t have space to download
massive data. So I won’t be able to illustrate KEGG here.</p>

<p>The enrichement test function requires the feed the reference argument. One
can either download the whole reference or connect on online db.
The following code will create a local database in the cache directory.
The location of the local cache can be found (and updated)
with <code>getAnnotationHubCache</code> and <code>setAnnotationHubCache</code>;
<code>removeCache</code> removes all cache resources.</p>
