<p>In this chapter, I will illustrate the principle of overpresentation analysis. There exist a variety of tools with different statistical methods.
A few review papers for details: <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-huangBioinformaticsEnrichmentTools2009" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>huangBioinformaticsEnrichmentTools2009?</strong></a>)</span></p>

<p>In this micro-array data due to that there are multiple probes match to
the same gene. For illustration of the PA purpose I simply removed the
duplicated gene probes.In pratice these duplicates should be removed with cautions.</p>

<p>Normally these gene sets should represent major players in biological
pathways. This can be achieved through the query from the biological
databases or from other analytical approach such as co-expression analysis.
For illustration purpose, here I randomly select 10 genes for each gene set.</p>

<p>Over-representation analysis (ORA) is used to determine which a priori defined
gene sets are more present (over-represented) in a subset of “interesting”
genes than what would be expected by chance <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-huangBioinformaticsEnrichmentTools2009" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>huangBioinformaticsEnrichmentTools2009?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The null hypothesis of ORA test:</strong> being differentally expressed and
belong to a particular pathway (gene set) are independent.</p>
<p><strong>Common statistical tests: </strong> chi-square test, Fisher’s exact test. Note
that when counts in a cell of a contigency table is small, chi-square
approximation may not be accurate.</p>
<p>The following examples tests the hypothesis for the gene sets described above
.</p>

<p>The advantage of ORA using R packages, most popular one <code>clusterProfile</code>
(which is the fusion of a few packages) is
that the functions combine the step of database query and the step of testing
in one go. The <code>clusterProfile</code> package currently provide following
biological database.
<img src="https://yulab-smu.top/biomedical-knowledge-mining-book/figures/clusterProfiler-diagram.png" alt="curtesy of clusterProfiler" /></p>
<p>As shown in the graph, the ORA tests with different db queries are prefixed
with <code>enrich</code>, such as <code>enrichGO</code>, <code>enrichDO</code>. Note that these functions
are different than the test above. They first query the biological process
databases and find the genes lie in the pathway(s). Then it will perform the test to see if the genes in the pathways are differentially expressed compared
to the background genes. For example, I’m interested in
the top 10 most significantly differentially expressed genes. I would like
to query the pathways that these genes involve in then test if these pathways
are significantly differentially expressed.</p>

<li>universe: a <strong>character</strong> vector of gene entrez ID in the background gene set</li>
<li>ontology type: biological ontology type. This varies from different reference database. Check specific database for details.</li>
<li>reference database: some function requires the input of database. one can
either use the connection to online db or download to local. This takes big
storage space.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation of results:</strong></p>
<p>I use the result from the following GO enrichment analysis for illustration. This applies
to the analytical results queried from other databases. From the result object,
one can see that the these top genes were mapped onto 94 gene sets (GO terms).
Out of these 94 sets, 31 were tested significant. The significance cutoff set
up is illustrated in the result object.
To interpret the result table, take the examplle of GO term <code>GO:0043186</code> as
an example. This GO term contains 10 genes, out of the 10 genes, only one
gene is found in our queried list, which contains 6 genes. So the <code>GeneRatio</code>
is 1/6. The pathway. In the background gene set (BgRatio), there are 10
out of 11599 genes. From this we can construct a contingency table below and
perform the Fisher test:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th></th>
<th>GO term</th>
<th>non-Go term</th>

<tr class="odd">

<ul>
<li>Simple and straitforward</li>
<li>can be used for exploratory analysis when there’s no prior hypothesis about
any biological mechanism.</li>
<li>However, can not infer the directly of differentially expressed pathway
e.g. up-regulated or down-regulated. This is not so helpful when particularly
interested in the pathways that a drug modulate.</li>
<li>does not address the intercorelations of genes.
## Further info
Below is an incomplete sumamry of the ORA.</li>
