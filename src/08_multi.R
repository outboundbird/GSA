#' # Multiplicity issue
#' Gene set analysis or pathway analysis usually contains multiple pathways or gene sets. This poses a question of adjustment of multiple testing. Conventially, plenty of methods have been developed to address this issue. However the unique character in the pathway analysis is that these pathways are often interrelated to each other. Thus each of the pathway cannot be considered as "independent" entity. This makes us to reconsiderate the way of setting up threshold for controlling false positive results.
