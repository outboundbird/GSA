## Organization of this e-book
I will illustrate the gene pathway analysis using a public dataset for smoking study.
Chapter 2 contains information on this study and how to obtain the dataset
from NCBI website to an R environment.
Chapter 3 quickly illustrate the differential gene expression analysis. This
result will be used in some of the parametrical pathway analysis method.
Chapter 4 introduce over-representation analysis
Chapter 5 introduce the classic gene set enrichment analysis
Chapter 6 talks abou the gene set variation analysis
Chapter 7 discusses other methods for gene set enrichment analysis
Chapter 8 talks about advanced topic regarding gene set analysis
